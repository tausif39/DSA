1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,270
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,590
So in this video, we will discuss how to realities are actually stored.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,070
So, for example, if it will create a windy area, let's say five, the size is five.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,840
So what will happen?

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,620
So basically you will get five blocks of memory, five blocks of continuous memory, and the size will

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,490
be don't debate.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,950
And let's say if we want to take in what we will do, you will create a variable and you will take the

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,130
value of N from the user and let's say the value of industry.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:36,270
So the value of industry, I will use the first three blocks and these two blocks are not used now.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,740
Similarly, let us consider to the idea, for example, if you create a Tooryalai letter to the number

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,300
of rules are five and the number of columns are also five.

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,640
So what will happen?

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,580
You will get five rows and five columns.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,280
So first or second or third row, fourth and fifth row, similarly, first column, second and third,

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,710
fourth and fifth column.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,980
And now let's see what I will take.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,870
So I will take the value of rows and columns, input from the user.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,780
So I'm going to create a variable eminent and the user will give me the value of them, which is the

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,240
number of rules and which is the number of columns.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,050
Let's say the value of em is three and the value of these.

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,060
So what I will do, I will take.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,580
So I will make use of three rows and only two columns.

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,640
So only this much part of the judiciary will be used.

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,730
So just like this one.

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:34,270
So in this case, I'm using three blocks and in this case I'm using only these three three rows and

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:34,960
two columns.

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,680
So this is not actually how my daughter is, Astwood.

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,770
So there are two ways of storing my duty.

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,260
So first one is actually rule major.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,330
And second one is actually called Amedure.

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,060
So, Collum.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,490
Column major, and what is the difference?

33
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,630
So let's say this is one, two, three, four, five.

34
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:13,880
And then six, seven, eight, nine and 10, so it will be 15, then 20, and then here you will have

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,470
25.

36
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,960
So in the room we your form.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,710
So what I will do.

38
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,280
So this is actually five crossway.

39
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,740
So first thing is same between major general media.

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,170
What we will have, you will have vendetti.

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,450
Basically, this is your salary and it size will be five to five, that is, there will be total twenty

42
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,180
five elements.

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,700
So the first index is going to be zero and the last index is going to be 25 24 because there are 25

44
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,090
blocks.

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,370
So the last index is going to be drawn before I'm repeating myself.

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,550
So this matrix is actually five gross five and how this is actually stored.

47
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,520
So the first step is same for the Mejor.

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,570
What they call a major what is happening inside the memory, you will get a one diary, you will get

49
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,010
a continuous block of memory.

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,140
Twenty five blocks of continuous memory.

51
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,030
First index is obviously zero.

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,190
And the last index is obviously 24 now in the major form.

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,250
So so this is so this is, let's say, four major.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,830
And now this is called major.

55
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,900
Again, the size of the area will be the same.

56
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,140
This is your zero index and this is your index 24.

57
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,780
So this is your column, Mejor.

58
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,130
Now, what really happens in the room is what I will do, so I will storm the first row.

59
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,210
So this will be one, two, three, four and five.

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,190
Then I will stop the second row, then I will stop the third row.

61
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,440
Then I was told the full truth and finally I will throw the fifth through.

62
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,180
So this will be 25, then 24, then 23 and so on.

63
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,030
Similarly, this will be six, then seven and so on.

64
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,880
So this is all major.

65
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,830
We are starting railway's.

66
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,510
So we are starting railway's first, I'm starting the first row.

67
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:11,820
Then the second row then stored the third row, then stored the photo and then stored the fifth through.

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,490
So this is how room works.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,290
And what Escola Major, you can guess, first stored the first column.

70
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,150
Then stole the second column, so first let us throw the first column, so this will be one, then it

71
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,330
will be six, then it will be 11, then it will be basically 16 and so on.

72
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,280
So first stop, the first column.

73
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,770
Then stole the second column, then stole the third column, so this was his first, this column will

74
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,290
be stored, then this column.

75
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,860
So first this column will be stored, then this column will be stored, then this column, then this

76
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,230
column and finally this column.

77
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:56,580
So the last five elements will be 25, then 20, then 15, then 10 and then five.

78
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:06,000
I hope you understood both so Roumeliotis store, Roberto stole the first row, then stole the second

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,030
row, then third, then fourth, then fifth and so on.

80
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,140
And in column media, I am going to store column by column.

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,490
So first store the first column.

82
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,570
Then he was told the second column, then installed the third column, then install the fourth column

83
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,140
and so on.

84
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,410
Now among these two rule major is actually the correct one.

85
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,020
So we use this rule, Major.

86
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,940
I'm repeating myself.

87
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,230
So this is how we visualize our judiciary.

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,280
So this is only for visualisations now inside the memory, inside our system.

89
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,940
This Tuori matrix is actually stored as a one dimensional Larry.

90
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,530
And to store this one dimensionality, basically there are two approaches.

91
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,230
First is the major approach.

92
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,230
Second is the major approach.

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,110
So among these two approaches, Romelio approach is used.

94
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,710
So we are going to use ROADM approach and media approach is not used.

95
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,540
It is very rarely used.

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,160
All the systems in today's world uses our approach now in the roomier approach.

97
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,850
Let's see how it will work.

98
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:16,360
So, for example, if you want to store something, let's say my ETA is a, again, five Roosen, five

99
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,570
columns, so you will get fifers.

100
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,630
And you will get five columns, correct, so the first, second, third and fourth and fifth through

101
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,450
similarly first column, second, third, fourth and fifth column.

102
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,000
And now let's say you want to do something like this.

103
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,510
Go to Secondo, you want to do aof to one equals seven, so this is zero, one, two, three and four.

104
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
This is zero one, two, three and four.

105
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,800
Now we are going to visualize it like this, but actually it will be stored as a one degree.

106
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,480
So after one.

107
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,980
So this is two and one.

108
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,570
So here I will store seven.

109
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,900
For visualisations, this is correct, but how it will actually be getting.

110
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,760
So basically, again, you will have a one very.

111
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,340
And we are actually going to stay in the room.

112
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,760
So this is index zero, this is index 24.

113
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,290
Now I want to throw this element seven.

114
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,100
So what we have to do, we have to find the index.

115
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,770
So basically, you have to convert the politician to come on in today, one day.

116
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,120
So this is one theory.

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,320
So you have to find the correct index for inserting Tucumán.

118
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,370
And how we can find that correct next.

119
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,310
So basically, let's see, so this is to come out when so what we have to do.

120
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,660
So we have to skip first rule, then we have to skip second.

121
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,770
So how many cells?

122
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,870
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

123
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,390
So how many cells we have to skip?

124
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,960
So first of all, the value of.

125
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,160
So this is actually true.

126
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,410
So you have to skip torus.

127
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,310
So this is, first of all, that you have to say this is the second law that you have to skip and then

128
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,180
you have to skip one column.

129
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,450
So two rules plus one column.

130
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,460
And how many elements, how many cells are present in the rules?

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,960
So in one rule, there are five elements, five cents.

132
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,870
So two the five plus one.

133
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,530
So basically we have to skip 11 cells.

134
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,790
We have to skip 11 cents and we have to insert our element into Quetzal, so we will we will insert

135
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,070
seven inside.

136
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,090
Well, to sell.

137
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,630
Now that Dalziell will be present at the next eleven, so at index eleven, because the indexing starts

138
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,860
from zero, so that 12th is actually index eleven in one dimension.

139
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,750
So you will store seven at index eleven of this.

140
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,760
So actually, what happens so this calculation, so this calculation, we will not do this calculation,

141
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,640
this calculation is actually automatically done by our system.

142
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,520
So internally, our toread internally, our Julietta is actually going to be stored in the room with

143
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,260
our form, basically only one.

144
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,940
And this calculation, the calculation of finding the correct index.

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,560
So this is going to be done by our system automatically.

146
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:28,360
Can we generate the formula so, for example, I want to insert that I excel and a great column.

147
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,210
So what is what will be our formula?

148
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,140
So here we can see.

149
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,230
If the value of so this is actually a.

150
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,670
And this is actually Jay.

151
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:49,100
So so we have to insert at index 11, so for finding the 11, what would you multiply to what is two?

152
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:55,430
Two is a so you will multiply with how many cells are present in one room.

153
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,940
So five other cells present in one room.

154
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,580
Basically, these are the columns.

155
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,150
So these are the columns.

156
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,280
And what is the value of column.

157
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,100
So let's see.

158
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,330
So are the nodes, Ruth.

159
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,300
And see the notes column, so I multiply.

160
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,990
And then basically this plus one is actually the value of.

161
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,940
So you will add plushy.

162
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,820
So this is the formula for calculating the index.

163
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,190
So just let us take an example.

164
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,240
So let's say you want to insert at.

165
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,310
Three.

166
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,170
Komada.

167
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,330
So according to this one.

168
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:47,020
After all, this is three and this is two, so let's say you want to insert element did now let us use

169
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,260
this formula so the value of it is two.

170
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,130
So this is your eye and this is your job.

171
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,190
So three, multiply.

172
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,320
How many columns are there?

173
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,300
So you can see there are five columns.

174
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,210
So that's why I told you the value of column is mandatory.

175
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,990
Rules are not mandatory because in the formula column will be getting column is getting used, not rules.

176
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,980
So there are five columns.

177
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,350
And what is the value of Jayco?

178
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,280
So the value of JASTA.

179
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,690
So according to this formula you should insert what elements of three to five, fifteen plus two.

180
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,570
You should insert the element at index 17.

181
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,310
So let's say this is your index at 17 and here you will store the element eight.

182
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,140
Now let's see with that.

183
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,720
Our output is whether this formula is correct or wrong.

184
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,880
So skip one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

185
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,670
16, 17 and 18.

186
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,100
So basically, you have to skip 17 cents.

187
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,290
So how many cells we have to skip?

188
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,600
We have to skip 17 cells.

189
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,180
That means I want to insert at PNL.

190
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,830
And in the area, the indexing starts from zero, so it means the index is going to be seventeen.

191
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,240
So this is the formula and you have to remember this formula.

192
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:09,910
So finally so finally, this is I am writing the result for you if you are creating an eddy.

193
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:18,410
The number of rose are the number of columns Arcy, so a number of rules are denoted by capital letters

194
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,990
and number of columns signed in order by capital letters C.

195
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:30,460
And if you want to insert if you want to access it raw and get column, so the formula for finding the

196
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,020
correct index is actually a minus, I multiply.

197
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,850
So this is a multiple C plus G.

198
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,870
This is a major.

199
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:00,980
So what is the formula in Oddisee number of rules sees the number of columns you want to access at Rule

200
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,360
Gate column.

201
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,950
So this is nothing.

202
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,700
This is just I will get multiplied with the columns.

203
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,390
Disvalue.

204
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,110
And you will plushy.

205
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,010
So this is for all media and all the computers users through media.

206
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,310
So if you want to find out the formula for media, what you will do, you will just write the opposite.

207
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:32,350
Basically interchange, RNC and interchange and simple, just everything will become Abbasid.

208
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,110
So Romeijn is not important.

209
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,950
Our system stored the data in Romijn form.

210
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,400
So that's why this formula is important.

211
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,310
And that's why I told you the value of column is mandatory.

212
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,350
Viterelli of column is mandatory.

213
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,150
So even if you will not give the value of our so you are not giving the value of our letter.

214
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,940
When you are initializing the array you are not giving the value of are not in order to access it through

215
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,830
and yet column.

216
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,650
What do you need.

217
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,360
You need only the value of C.

218
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:09,340
You can see in this formula R is not used, you only need the value of C, so that's why the value of

219
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,450
C is mandatory.

220
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,180
You have to give value of C so that so that system can use this formula.

221
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,720
So that's why the value is important.

222
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,050
That's why it's mandatory and similarly.

223
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,950
So you can see here what we are doing.

224
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,910
So let's say.

225
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,270
We do not initialize the.

226
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,170
So let's say I'm creating an.

227
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,930
So this is.

228
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:44,210
Let's say the column surrendered and let's say the rules are five five rules and.

229
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,130
And let us take input from the user only.

230
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,540
So what we are doing here and now, let us call Brent at a function.

231
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:14,570
Now, if you remember, I told you that whenever you are passing a toread as input to a function, you

232
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,180
have to pass the number of columns.

233
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,390
So here the name of the array is actually.

234
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,620
You will give them and you will give an.

235
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,240
So what we are doing here?

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,460
So what we have to do here, so if you remember that I told you that whenever you want to pass a duty

237
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,770
to a function, you have to give a number of columns, not the number of rules, number of rules.

238
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,590
That option number of columns are mandatory.

239
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:51,690
So I'm creating an array of five rows and columns then the value of his input.

240
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:58,320
I am taking that as input that I'm calling the function print that I'm giving and adding so many are

241
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,720
correct.

242
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,500
But here what you are doing, you are writing H.I.G..

243
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,900
And what is the formula for AIG, so the formula is I multiply columns plus G.

244
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:18,480
Now my question is how this function will be able to find the value of C, C, the number of columns.

245
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,110
So there is no way that this function can find out the value of C.

246
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,550
So what we have to do, we have to pass the value of the and how we will pass.

247
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,780
So this is C C is actually handled, so you have to pass.

248
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,420
So that's why you have to write under here.

249
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,930
So it was a letter five.

250
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,650
Now you have to write under there.

251
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:44,160
That's why I told you that whenever you are passing your duty at it as input to a function, the value

252
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,270
of the rule are optional.

253
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,050
You give or do not give, it is your choice, but the value of columns.

254
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:55,160
Have to be given, so you have to give the number of columns and this should match these two values

255
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,480
should match 100 and Hender, then only this formula is valid.

256
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,260
Then only we will be able to find out the correct index, so if you will pass it here, then she will

257
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,980
become Hundert.

258
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,410
So that's why whenever I always remember, the value of column is very, very important.

259
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,500
So that's why you have to write under there.

260
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,270
I hope I am clear to you.

261
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,790
And all of this is valid because.

262
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,550
Other systems stole our daughter in law media reform, this is your one lady, so your daughter will

263
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,090
actually will be stored in this one.

264
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,540
The first the first one will get stored.

265
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,290
So first we'll come here, then second, then third row will come, then footrot will come, then we

266
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,390
will come, then six will come and so on.

267
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,030
So for me, this is the formula.

268
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:52,900
And I hope you can remember this from last remembering this family is really important, and I hope

269
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,530
you guys know that while we have to pass the value of columns to the function and why we have to give

270
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,000
the value of columns when you are creating a delivery because of this formula.

271
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,380
And because of how to react is I actually been told how to react if they're actually getting stored

272
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,570
in our system memory.

273
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,360
So if you have any doubt in this concept, you can definitely ask.

274
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,320
I will see in the next video by.
