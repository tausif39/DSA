int x[10][20];
Elements in two-dimensional arrays are commonly referred to by x[i][j] where i is the row number and ‘j’ is the column number.
A two – dimensional array can be seen as a table with ‘x’ rows and ‘y’ columns where the row number ranges from 0 to (x-1) and column number ranges from 0 to (y-1

    // an array with 3 rows and 2 columns.
    int x[3][2] = {{0,1}, {2,3}, {4,5}};
 
    // output each array element's value
