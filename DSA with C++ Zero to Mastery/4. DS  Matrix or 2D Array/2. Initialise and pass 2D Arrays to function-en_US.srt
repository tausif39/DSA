1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,260
I have even so in this lesson, we are going to learn how we can initialize our metrics or you can say

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,250
to them, gelati.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:17,480
So how do we initialize our Wendy area, so we write like this and let's say four elements and I will

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,000
give four values there to one, two, three and four.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,070
So this is the way for initializing, I wonder now how we can initialize our tutelary, so I will write

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,670
like this.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,580
I want to create a truly array of integers, many of the number of rows and columns, let's say two

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,110
rows and three columns, and I will initialize it like this.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,330
So I will give one, two and three.

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,430
So this is a content one, two and three, so this is the content for the first group.

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,640
Now I have to give one more, so then I will write four, five and six.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,900
So that's how I will initialize my to the area.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,670
So this will look like this, I have two rows and three columns.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,430
So in the first row, I will fill this element one, two, three.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,530
In the next room, I will fill these elements four, five and six.

16
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:26,230
So it is very simple to initialize our Tooryalai now and to create it basically giving rules is optional.

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,760
So giving rules is optional and giving columns is mandatory.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,970
So this is giving columns are mandatory and giving the value of rules are optional and we will see why

19
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,830
it is so but not in this video, probably in the next video.

20
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,240
So basically, I can write like this also.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,410
I want to create a tutelary, I do not want to give rules, and again, the columns are mandatory,

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,620
so we have to give columns and if I will write like this.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,970
One, two and three.

24
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,670
And let's say in the next room, four, five, four, five, six, and now seven, eight, nine.

25
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,940
OK, so this is not this is only coma.

26
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,220
And then this so be my final edit, so how many troops will be there so we can figure out with the help

27
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,250
of the number of elements that I'm trying to insert so I will have to use and the number of columns

28
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,460
are obviously given three to three rows and three columns.

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,930
What is the content of the first trial, it is one, two, three.

30
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,590
What is the content for the second four or five, six, and what is the content for the turtles?

31
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,340
Seven, eight, nine.

32
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,340
So that is the meaning of giving all is optional, giving rules is optional, but giving the number

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,710
of columns in it already is mandatory.

34
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,550
Now, let's not tell me what will happen if I try and do something like this.

35
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,430
And we I do not want to give the number of rules, but I want to give the number of columns which are

36
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,730
three.

37
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,250
And what is my content, so let's say one, two.

38
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,360
Now, let's.

39
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,940
Three, four, five.

40
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,830
And now let's see.

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,070
Seven and eight.

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,710
So what will be my duty, really, so one, two and three.

43
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,550
So first of all, I will have three rules and the number of columns have given three.

44
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,720
So this is three Grasstree.

45
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,930
Trigonometry, what is the content for the first, the content for the first rule is one, two, one

46
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,400
and two.

47
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,150
What is the content for the second or three, four and five?

48
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,070
What is the content for the third row, seven and eight?

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,540
And what will happen to the values which are not provided by the user?

50
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,890
So I will put zero there.

51
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,600
So this is just like one.

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,530
So in one day, if you will do something like this after and you give only one value, let's say one,

53
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,740
or do you give two values, then what will happen?

54
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,300
So basically you will get.

55
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:22,140
Four boxes and inside the first two boxes, the values would be one and two and the values will become

56
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,420
zero.

57
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,420
So that is what happening here.

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,770
All the values which which I will not provide, they will automatically become zero.

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,720
Simple.

60
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,730
So let's take one more example.

61
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,450
So let's see if I will do something like this.

62
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,100
I want to create a truly toread.

63
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,700
Let's say five crews will be there and four columns are going to be presented, and I give value like

64
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,420
this one and two, and then I give three and four.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,960
So what will happen?

66
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,430
So first of all, I'm going to have five crews and they will be four columns.

67
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,530
So first row, second row.

68
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,810
Third, fourth and fifth through.

69
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,840
And this is first column, second column, third and fourth column.

70
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,040
So what is the content for the first rule?

71
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,760
This is one and two, what is the content for the second?

72
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,850
This is three and four.

73
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,810
And what will happen to all the all these black boxes?

74
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,070
So they will become zero.

75
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,760
So zero will be placed everywhere.

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,430
So this is the desert.

77
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,840
So I hope you understood.

78
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,110
Now I want to initialize my complete matrix complete to the area with all the zeroes.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,250
So, for example, what I want to say here is.

80
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,280
So how do you create an area with all the zeros, how to initialize an array with all the zeros, so

81
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,380
you will have to write something like this individually?

82
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,910
Let's say you want to create a system, and if you write it like this, then what will happen?

83
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,760
So all the elements inside already.

84
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,060
So first of all, this element is zero.

85
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,170
So that's why the first element will become zero and the rest of the elements are going to become zero.

86
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,820
Now I want to initialize my toread with all the zeros again, the syntax is very simple.

87
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,180
Let certain rules and then columns and you will write it something like this zero.

88
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,540
So what will happen again?

89
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,220
You will get a 10, Gosplan.

90
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,870
Tutelary, so this is zero nine and again, zero nine and all the values inside the studio today will

91
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,050
be zeroes, so zeros will be there.

92
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,630
So that's hope we can initialize our to Matrix with all the zeros simple.

93
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,650
So now let us try to print all this, because I know we should not trust someone.

94
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,510
We should write the code and then we should see what our output will be.

95
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,220
So let's say.

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,910
OK, so first of all, let us create a function.

97
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,320
So how do we create a function, so let us create a function print, Eddie.

98
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,460
So this brain function, what it will take.

99
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,840
It will take, obviously, the effort to do damage.

100
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,200
Larry.

101
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,670
It will take how many rules are there and it will take how many columns are there?

102
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,520
Then they have to do so, let's copy this so-called.

103
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm going to print the content of the dreary roadways and all of this comment, everything from here.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,830
So what I will do, I will not take the input.

105
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,450
I would just like to call the function so.

106
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,250
Let us initialize already.

107
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:21,550
So the I do not want to give the number of rules because giving number of rules are optional, I just

108
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,990
want to give the number of columns.

109
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,730
So let's say the number of columns are two.

110
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,810
Correct.

111
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,930
So now let us initialize our address or the first, let's say one to.

112
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,590
Now, let's say I want to give Tecoma for.

113
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,560
So this is going to have to do so, we have to call this function Braintree.

114
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,050
So let's call it a function.

115
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,650
So I have to pass the ADA, so let's pass any sort of way of passing the ADA is exactly the same.

116
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,540
We are passing the ADA just like we used to pass in one Michelet and just the name of the crazy enough.

117
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,110
Then how many rules so there are two rules and there are two columns, so the value of mining in to

118
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,580
commit to.

119
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,800
Correct.

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,390
Now one thing, so this court is not correct.

121
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:23,660
Why?

122
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,490
It is not correct.

123
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,680
Because I told you giving rules are optional, but giving columns are mandatory.

124
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,050
So giving column time and it is all this is the same if you want to pass a Tooryalai, giving columns

125
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,800
are mandatory.

126
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:45,010
So what I want to say here is just like I told you, that when you are creating to really giving, the

127
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,280
values of rules are optional, but giving the values of columns are mandatory.

128
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,760
Similarly, when you want to pass an added function, so we want to pass a TOORYALAI to a function.

129
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,370
So giving the rules.

130
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:06,460
So giving the rules are again optional, but giving the number of columns are mandatory while it is

131
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,120
mandatory.

132
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,260
We will see it in the next video.

133
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,320
So this is too.

134
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,610
So that's why you have to right.

135
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,150
To hear.

136
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,180
OK, so let's test our program.

137
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,900
So this is my output went to 2004.

138
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,530
Now, let's do some experiments.

139
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,020
Now, let's say instead of two.

140
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,870
If the number of columns are five, so what should be my output?

141
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,090
So again, if you are making it five, then you have to write five here also because the number of columns

142
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,700
should be seen.

143
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,880
So this value and this value, they should be.

144
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,240
This is the requirement and why this is the requirement.

145
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,160
We will see it in the next video.

146
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,020
So let's run our program.

147
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,050
OK, so one thing that I did wrong here is so the number of columns, actually five.

148
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,580
Now, let's run again.

149
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,880
So now you can see.

150
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,210
So there are Zulu's besant everywhere.

151
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,970
So this will be so when until then, then the content of the second are three and four and then the

152
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,590
all the three rest columns will become zero.

153
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,930
So this is the output.

154
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:31,910
Correct.

155
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,350
And again, I'm repeating myself, giving the value of columns are mandatory, Vytenis mandatory.

156
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,630
We will see it in the next video.

157
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
So you have to five.

158
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,200
So this value and this value they should match.

159
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,290
Otherwise your output will be wrong.

160
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,400
Moeletsi.

161
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,510
Now, let's say the number of are also five is the number of rules at five.

162
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,280
Let's change.

163
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,660
Let's make five here.

164
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,380
So now let's try to test our program.

165
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,320
So thereas you lose Besant everywhere.

166
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,860
So let me explain this output to you.

167
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,270
So, again, there are five rules and five columns, so you will get a five cross, five matrix.

168
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,120
The content of the first rule is to the content of the second rule, and for rest they will be zeros

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,690
everywhere.

170
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,280
So zero zero zero.

171
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,520
So that's where you can see how many zeros are there.

172
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,530
And can we initialize our The Matrix with zeroes?

173
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,120
Yes, we definitely we can.

174
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,110
So how will initialise ever truly matics with the rules, so let us create an already let them be.

175
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,040
Number of rules, again, optional.

176
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,500
Let's say there are five rows and five columns.

177
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,160
And I want to initialize my area with all the zeroes, so I will try to zero here simple.

178
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,910
And I will call I will pass very.

179
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,170
So you can see is present everywhere.

180
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,470
So in this video, we learned two important things.

181
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,040
First thing is basically how to initialize our to the Matrix, how to initialize our to the area.

182
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,110
We learned how we can initialize our Tooryalai.

183
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,360
And the second thing is basically when you're initializing the to the array, giving the value of Ruza

184
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,590
optional, but giving the values of columns military similarly when you are passing.

185
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:47,750
So when you are passing your Tooryalai to a function, then the number of rules, so the value of you

186
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,260
can give rules, but given the value of columns are mandatory.

187
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,850
So when you are passing function, when you are passing to the area to a function, so giving the value

188
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,200
of columns are mandatory.

189
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,270
So this is mandatory.

190
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,580
And the value should be same.

191
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,750
And giving the value of rules are optional.

192
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,360
So this is optional.

193
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:19,160
Now, the next video, we will discuss why giving the value of condoms are mandatory, so I will see

194
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,850
you in the next one.

195
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,810
Bye bye.
